# DIS22 ML Project

## Team CNN Architecture
This Repository contains the code from the DIS22 ML Project Team CNN Architecture.
Most of the Code is adapted from the original code repository of [sustainlab-group](https://github.com/sustainlab-group/africa_poverty)

Please find a Sphinx Documentation in this repository, which for now contains only the code of the CNN Architecture Team.

For a visualised dataflow, look at the miro board [Timeflow CNN](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lC6R8PY=/).
While the diagrams "DHS Data sustainlab-group" and "LSMS Data" show the original dataflow by sustainlab-group, the diagram "DHS Data DIS 22" shows the shortened and adapted way used in this repository.
